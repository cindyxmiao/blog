I’m Cindy, a computer engineering student at UBC. Follow along with me in this tempestuous but exciting university journey, from finding an internship and studying for exams, to living on my own and learning more about our world.

Things I do when I’m not studying:
- Read books 
- Go on a run
- Draw
- Hang out with friends
