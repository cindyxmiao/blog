<p>
  All first year engineering students at UBC take the same general courses
  (besides the arts elective). For each course, I outline the content, amount of
  work, and study recommendations. I’ll try to limit my own biases but keep in
  mind these are my experiences and everyone’s experience/skills are different.
  Also, different profs make a huge difference so I will recommend some good
  ones I had from my first year in engineering.

  These 2 courses are the UBC engineering first year project courses, 1 in first
  term and the other in term 2. You learn about engineering design theories, and
  apply them to projects. For each class, you get randomly assigned a group of 4
  or 5 teammates and together, you do projects like building a cardboard chair,
  desiging a mechanical claw, writing a report recommending a water system, or
  designing a 3D printed device in CAD for a handicapped person.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prof: un-choose-able! We had the same profs for all sections.</li>
  <li>
    Coursework: 1 project/month, plus weekly video lectures to watch and quizzes
    following these lectures. Also has team quizzes 1 lecture per week,
    tutorials (project-work time), and midterms + finals where you get tested on
    all the video lecture things.
  </li>
  <li>
    Study Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Start early on the projects. At the beginning of each project, the pace
        in tutorials are super slow. However, in the last week it is due, there
        is always a lot to do. So always review what needs to be done for each
        project early, and divide up the tasks or plan meetings.

<p>
  The first university level physics you will take, so definitely takes a while
  to get used to. Especially the first unit regarding stress/tensions, homework
  questions were extremely challenging at first. However, once you get used to
  it, and start paying attention in class and using web resources (+
  repetition), it becomes much easier. I found that at the end of the term, I
  started to really understand the concepts and questions in the first unit.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Prof: Mark Raamsdonk - amazing prof, so if you get the chance please take
    his course. Our class had a ~10% higher average than other classes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Coursework: Weekly/biweekly written assignments, online quizzes before
    lectures.
  </li>
  <li>
    Study Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>Read the textbook before lectures so you can follow along</li>
      <li>
        Really good open source textbook->
        <a

          >Libretexts</a

        all the units we need to cover

<p>
  If you have already taken AP Calculus AB, this is pretty much the same. I had
  credits from taking AP Calc in highschool, but retook the course because I
  thought the university version would be more in depth, and other people have
  recommended me to retake it as well for the same reason. However, after taking
  MATH 100 myself, I realized it was pretty much a repeat of AP Calculus, and
  not worth the time, stress and money to do again if you already have credits.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Prof: I highly recommend Dragos Ghioca. He is awesome, and explains concepts
    thoroughly and gives examples. For math courses, you can basically go and
    listen to any lecture, since there are no marks for participation. Just make
    sure to go to your registered section when it comes to midterms! I wasn't
    registered in Dragos' section, but still went for his classes.
  </li>
  <li>Weekly online problems.</li>
  <li>
    Study Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>Do ~5 practice exams to prepare for midterms/finals!</li>
    </ul>

<p>
  Mostly an extension of Chemistry 12, and a mix of memorization and math. Also
  had a lab component, but that was only once a month. Writing the lab report
  during the lab was kind of annoying, but the lab itself was very chill: there
  was plenty of time and you can ask the TA’s to help with anything.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prof: Chris Addition.</li>
  <li>
    Coursework: There are a set of ~15 online problems every week, plus some in
    class quizzes.
  </li>
  <li>
    Study Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Recommend this website for reviewing concepts that are not clear:
        <a
          href="https://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/topicreview/bp/ch21/chemical.php"
          >Purdue Education</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        If I was transported back in time into first year and had to take this
        class again, I would probably do the workbook every week and check my
        answers. The workbook questions are very similar to exam ones.

<p>
  Introduction to programming for engineering students, using the language C.
  The first half of the course is focused on learning to code in C, and the
  second half is using DAQ hardware to detect inputs. One of the easier courses
  in first year engineering at UBC, not a lot of homework and easy to understand.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Prof: Paul Carter (very good) and Paul Davis. The first half of the course
    was taught by the good Paul, the second half by the other Paul.
  </li>
  <li>
    Coursework: This course is known as a “flipped lecture”, meaning that the
    course material is taught online in the form of videos made by the
    professor. You are expected to watch these on your own time every week.
    Then, everyone works on worksheets in class that practices the material
    taught in videos.
  </li>
  <li>
    Study Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Keep up and finish the worksheets (on paper -- because exams are always
        written on paper) if you didn’t get a chance to in class. If you
        finished in class, always check your answers later.
      </li>

<p>
  Engineering students are required to take this first year english course.
  Mostly focuses on the scientific method (research papers, etc).
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Prof: Tara Lee. Her class is very chill, and she is sophisticated and uses
    fancy vocabulary. Easy marker as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Coursework: This depends heavily on your professor, since they have the
    freedom to teach/evaluate however they want. For my english class, we had
    weekly readings (scientific research papers) from a textbook, and we had to
    write 1 summary, 2 rhetorical essays and 1 research paper. The final exam
    consisted of a summary and a rhetorical analysis, with the topic of the
    rhetorical analysis based on the weekly readings. Overall, I didn’t do a lot
    of work for this class (except when essays were due) and barely did the
    readings until final exams.
  </li>
  <li>
    Study Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>Start writing your essays early, and spend some time on them.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;" id="phys158">PHYS 158</h3>

<p>
  A continuation of PHYS 157 from term 1. However, beware that this course is a
  lot harder. I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that the slides are
  very disorganized and there are way too many topics covered in such a short
  time.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Prof: Marina Litinskaya. She's very good at explaining during office hours.
  </li>
  <li>
    Coursework: Prepare to spend some time on your own learning the concepts or
    going to office hours to ask questions and get a better understanding. I
    actually ended up going to BYC final preparation for this course, the only
    BYC I went to in first year.
  </li>
  <li>
    Study Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        As with PHYS 157, the online libretext has the contents of this course
        and is very useful:
        <a
          href="https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/Book%3A_University_Physics_(OpenStax)/Map%3A_University_Physics_II_-_Thermodynamics%2C_Electricity%2C_and_Magnetism_(OpenStax)/5%3A_Electric_Charges_and_Fields"
          >LibreTexts II</a
        >
      </li>
      <li>
        Actually read the readings before going to lecture or you will be
        completely lost and have to go to BYC like me.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

<h3 style="margin-bottom: 20px;" id="math101">MATH 101</h3>

<p>A continuation of Math 100, but only integrals.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prof: Nicolau Sarquis Aiex, he's great!</li>
  <li>
    Coursework: Do a lot of problems from the CLP problem section where they mix
    the integrals, so you have to think about which integration technique to
    use. That was basically the whole course - recognizing which integration
    technique to use as fast as possible. I was able to get a really good grade
    in this course just by doing the CLP mixed integrals section.
  </li>
  <li>
    Study Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        For harder topics like optimization, I really like to listen to Prof.
        Leonard’s online lectures on Youtube. You can find them here:
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/professorleonard57"
          >Prof. Leonard</a
        >. They are super helpful for understanding and also for examples.

<p>
  Similar to dynamics in physics 12, this course consists of drawing free body
  diagrams, and calculating the different forces on an object. But don’t worry,
  PHYS 170 is very easy compared to the other physics courses, mostly because
  there are only a few types of problems, and once you learn how to do a few
  problems, you can do all of them. I think this was the easiest course in first
  year.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Prof: Malcolm McMillan. Very nice and good at teaching. He often dismisses
    the class half an hour early since he doesn't actually do the problem again
    but explains instead how he dervives the answer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Coursework: Weekly problems ~3 online. In tutorials, you get into a group of
    4, and solve 1 problem together.
  </li>
  <li>
    Study Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        During class, try to follow along by doing the problem yourself the same
        time the professor explains it. Bring your graphing calculator and get
        the result on your calculator as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Do all the posted past final exams! Our final had the exact same
        questions as a few of the past final exams, except with different
        numbers.
      </li>

<p>
  Linear Algebra, involving vectors, planes and matrices. Very different from
  calculus. I struggled with this course a lot in the beginning (getting 55-60%
  in midterms), and then I went to listen to Elyse Yeager’s class, and the rest
  is history. I ended up with low 80’s at the end. I don't think the material is
  hard, but it is very different from anything I've seen before, and I had a
  poor professor, so it didn't make sense to me for quite a while.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prof: My prof was not so good -- I highly recommend Elyse Yeager.</li>
  <li>Coursework: Weekly online problems.</li>
  <li>
    Study Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Listen to Elyse Yeager’s class. Or you could find her recorded lectures
        here, but they are the last ⅓ of the course:
        <a
          href="https://mediasitemob1.mediagroup.ubc.ca/Mediasite/Catalog/catalogs/MATH-152"
          >Math 152 Video Lectures</a
        >. They actually started recording 2/3 of the way through the course
        because too many people started showing up to Yeager's class, to the
        point where there were no more seats and people had to stand.
      </li>

<p>
  A one credit physics lab. Usually averages are very high, except it requires a
  lot of effort—considering that it is a 1 credit course—in writing the pre-labs
  and finishing lab papers each week.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Prof: Not really important.</li>
  <li>
    Coursework: Weekly labs. Takes about 5 hours/week outside of lab time to
    write results (or I’m just slow).
  </li>
  <li>
    Study Recommendations:
    <ul>
      <li>Not much to study for.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
