summary: "My 5-year plan: get an internship at a big tech company, go on exchange, be part of student council, and join
a design team. On the surface, those seem like good goals, but I couldn’t help but feel unsettled. What was the purpose
of it all? Was it so I could be the one that other parents praised as an example for their own kids? More importantly,
did these goals come from me, or were they just a product of the society I lived in, of the intersection of a time and a
place?"

<p>My 5-year plan: get an internship at a big tech company, go on exchange, be part of student council, and join a
    design team. On the surface, those seem like good goals, but I couldn’t help but feel unsettled. What was the
    purpose of it all? Was it so I could be the one that other parents praised as an example for their own kids? More
    importantly, did these goals come from me, or were they just a product of the society I lived in, of the
    intersection of a time and a place?</p>

<p>In recent years in North America, and perhaps elsewhere as well, there has been an emergence of the idea of
    meritocracy – that “economic goods and/or political power [should be] vested in individual people on the basis of
    talent, effort, and achievement…measured through examination or demonstrated achievement.” Although this ideology
    cannot truly be realized in such a society where people are already placed on an uneven playing field from the
    moment they are born, its ideals has been largely incorporated into society and into the eyes of its citizens.
    Parents are scrambling to send their kids to learn this and that and pushing them to do well in school in the hopes
    that success will follow. Universities evaluate its applicants based on examination scores, and then personal
    achievements. </p>

<p>Have you ever opened up someone’s Facebook profile, and flipped through with envious eyes? They’ve worked at all the
    big corporations, was the leader of this, the vice president of that, won several scholarships and awards, and their
    profile, full of pictures with different friends and colleagues. </p>

<p style="display: inline-block"> And you think to yourself, </p> <i style="display: inline-block"> this </i>
<p style="display: inline-block">is what the best life looks like, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Quite a handful of my friends are doing very well – in medical school or on the way, doing research with professors,
    an executive member of several clubs, and being so “busy” and “fulfilled”.</p>

<i style="display: inline-block"> This </i>
<p style="display: inline-block">is what the best life looks like, isn’t it?</p>

<p>That’s what I believed for a long time. But I think we should all re-evaluate our scales and metrics before working
    towards things we never wanted in the first place.
    Why is it that a singular definition, based solely on individual success and achievement, our only evaluation
    criteria for a purposeful life? What if someone had all the success in the world, but was ignorant, superficial, and
    unempathetic? Would you consider that a life well-lived? Furthermore, what about the effects they’ve had on others?

<p>And don’t tell me it’s happiness. As defined by psychology, an emotion is an immediate, specific negative or positive
    response to something we experience. It’s but a temporary state-of-being, a reaction to an event. Furthermore,
    psychological research has found that “humans quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major
    positive or negative events or life changes”. If we can’t get any happier in the long-term, then what is it that we
    should be chasing?</p>

<p>In the forgotten gaps of my time, taken up by entertainment in the forms of YouTube, Twitch and television shows, I
    had ignored the most valuable things I held– the ability to think, and the vast amount of accessible knowledge, like
    books and videos, telling people’s stories of a different time, place and culture. And that’s where I hope to find
    my answer: how are we to decide on the best way to live if we have known no other way than that of our own? </p>
