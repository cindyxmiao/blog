<p>That evening, while we were in the study lounge hard at work, preparing for the dreaded physics midterm, someone
    suddenly got up and yelled: "guys, class is cancelled tomorrow!!!"</p>

<p>"No way!"</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh, where where where?”</p>

<p>Lo and behold, there it was on the UBC website. </p>

<blockquote>All classes are cancelled on the #UBC Vancouver campus on Feb. 12 due to challenging commute conditions. An
    update on Feb. 13 classes will be posted here at 6:00 a.m. Feb. 13.</blockquote>

<p>While we were all ecstatic, our physics midterm was tomorrow evening, and a decision on evening classes wouldn't be
    made until noon the next day. Piazza exploded with comments.

<p>Everyone was watching this scene unfold - the unpredictability and excitement rivaled that of a sports game.</p>

<p>The next morning, I woke up early, and to my delight, snow was twirling down from the sky, blessing us with this
    wonderful snow day. Everyone was in a good mood. Snowmen came to life, joyously springing up from the ground .
    Some students, decked out in full snowboarding gear, hit the campus steps for a wild downhill adventure. Others
    used cafeteria trays as toboggans, sliding down and up and around.</p>

<p>I was at the library, enjoying the snow scene while studying for the math midterm. Then, I heard the news: the
    physics midterm was cancelled! And so we finally went out to enjoy the snow.</p>
