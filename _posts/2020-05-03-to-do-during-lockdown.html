  Originally I decided to take a break from my blog, and then I realized I have
  nothing to do. If you’re bored like me, here are some interesting and
  productive things to do during lockdown.
</p>

<h3>
  Move a chair into the backyard, watch the lazying clouds, and drift into
  reverie

  Often times, modern city life moves too fast, and seems too ordered.
  Everyone's in a rush to get somewhere, and catching up with old friends in a
  coffee shop even needs to be scheduled a week in advance, god forbit someone
  has a club meeting to go to, or an exam to study for. And don't get me started
  on the 40 hour working weeks. Why is it that when we have machines aiding us,
  we spend even more time working? This
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21j_OCNLuYg">Ted Talk</a> goes into
  more depth about this idea, and provides a unique perspective on rural vs city
  life.
</p>

<p>
  So now is the perfect time to slow down, lay down the alarm clock and put away
  the calendars; and instead, lay down on the grass, listen to the birds' song,
  and admire the hardworking ants carrying food bits as treasure to and fro.

<p>But if that's not really your thing, here are 9 other things to do...</p>

<br />

<h3>
  Make an excel sheet of your budget/spendings this past year or for next year
</h3>

<p>
  Back when I was in highschool, I would just spend all my tutoring money on
  getting bubble tea or going out to eat, without knowing how much I earned or
  how much I spent. And that turns into a big black hole of money, where money
  mysteriously disappears with you not knowing where it went. And the solution
  is having an excel sheet or budgeting tool.
</p>

  My monthly average of variable expenses (expenses not including rent,
  tuition). You can make your own budgeting spreadsheet using the categories
  given by the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada, or use a template
  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/tools" target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >.
</figcaption>

<br />
<p>
  Now I do not record all of my spendings immediately. Instead, I spent 1
  afternoon recently going through all my past credit card bills and debit card
  history to piece my yearly spendings together. The purpose of this is having a
  transparent record of where your money is going, and avoiding that black hole
  of mysterious and evaporated money. Furthermore, you can try to make
  adjustments to your spendings, for example, I should probably eat out less and
  make more food at home. I recommend doing this on a monthly or quarterly
  basis, which would provide more feedback and chances of re-adjustment.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Set some goals for the long haul</h3>
<p>
  I really enjoyed Stephen Dunier’s Ted Talk,
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQMbvJNRpLE" target="_blank"
    >How to Achieve Your Most Ambitious Goals</a
  >.
</p>
<p>
  As a highschool senior, I always wondered why my peers had these executive
  positions in clubs, or were very involved in a volunteer society, etc. I was
  more of a skipper, meaning I showed up to the first meeting/volunteer session
  and then never again. Determined to kill this habit in university, I started
  making a few goals for the year, like join a design team or get a job. And it
  actually helped me stick to things.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Read up on personal finance, stocks and investing</h3>
<p>
  A lot of people might think that trading stocks is like gambling or playing a
  game, where you try to predict when the stock is at its lowest to “buy the
  dip”. In fact, that was what I thought at first as well. Yet the stock market
  is so very different than that. If you look at the long term projection of the
  stock market, you’ll see that stocks always go up, and that the market always
  recovers from, and outgrows crashes or depressions given enough
  time<sup>1</sup>. So accordingly, one should invest in an index fund, which
  mimics the performance of the overall stock market (by including shares of
  many different companies), and leave the money in the market for an extended
  period of time. Then, we can be sure that our money will grow into more money.
</p>

  alt="a stack of coins beside a blurry clock"
/>

<p>
  What about savings accounts? Taking account that the annual inflation rate is
  around ~3%, whereas a high interest savings account only gives you ~1-3%,
  money in a savings account will barely outgrow inflation. An investment of
  “80% weighting in stocks and a 20% weighing in bonds has provided an average
  annual return of 9.5%, with the worst year -40%”. Again, one shouldn’t be
  intimidated by the -40%, since the market always goes up in the long haul.
</p>

<p>
  However that being said, there is definitely risk nevertheless. And this risk
  is dependent on how long you can put the money in the stock market. If you
  decide that you need the money before the market overcomes a bad depression,
  then you may lose money. So a lot of people invest in different weightings of
  stocks/bonds based on their age (bonds are less riskier, but provide less
  return long-term wise). John Boggle, the founder of the Vanguard Group and
  creator of the world's first retail index mutual fund, recommends your
  "roughly your age in bonds"; for instance, at age 45, about 45% of the
  portfolio should be allocated to high-quality bonds.

  provide an excellent intro to the stock market (one of my first financial
  readings), and details his investment philosophy.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Clean the house</h3>
<p>
  Who knows what treasures are buried in that closet, or tucked away in the
  garage? This is also a good time to burn those notes from your last term of
  school. Although the universe always tends toward entropy, some kind of order
  and cleanliness really improves the living environment.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Make food</h3>

<p>
  Being able to make some simple and healthy dishes that taste good had such a
  big impact on my life. In 2nd year, I lived on my own outside of campus, and
  had a kitchen. In the first term, I didn’t really know how to cook, and only
  made basic food (like stir fry bok choy and microwaved cheese on bread). I
  thought I didn’t have (1) time to cook and (2) skills to make good-tasting
  food. So I either ate campus food (which wasn’t that good either), or my own
  cooking. I got really sick of what I ate, so much that I bought a lot of junk
  food, and even had mochi and crab stick chips for dinner one day.
</p>

<p>
  During winter break, I stumbled upon a youtube channel full of really
  delicious food. And since I had more time in the second semester, I spent more
  time finding good recipes and cooking. And I felt totally different compared
  to term 1. I even didn’t have the urge to eat any snacks or chips because I
  made pretty good food anyways. Cooking at home not only saves money, but leads
  you to eat healthier.
</p>

<h3>Plan out your courses/academic year plan</h3>

<p>
  Before you say it, yes I’m a big fan of planning and spreadsheets. Plus, time
  at university actually flies by, so planning out your timeline + things to do
  (like internships, exchange, research) is a good idea.
</p>

<br />

<h3>Do something active:</h3>
<p>
  Now that summer is near, and the weather is better, why not go outside and
  enjoy the nice fresh air? Go outside for a jog, throw some frisbees, or go for
  a bike ride.
</p>

<p>
  A Twitch streamer that I like to watch once said that people who exercise may
  live longer, but poeple who don't exercise have the same amount of time alive
  because they are actually using exercise time to do other things. Obviously
  this is flawed logic, since exercising improves your quality of life, and
  sports are pretty fun too.
</p>

<p>
  If you have some dumbells at home, you can consider working out at home. And
  if you're new to this, you might find
  <a href="http://liamrosen.com/fitness.html" target="_blank">this guide </a>
  useful.

<br />
<h3>Undertake a coding project</h3>
<img

  alt="expenses spreadsheet"
  style="border-radius: 10px;"
/>
<p>
  If you’re in the software discipline, creating a personal project seems almost
  obligatory. But if you haven’t coded before, this could be a fun little
  project you can make while learning new things and potentially helping you in
  your career.
</p>

<p>
  For those with elementary programming skills or just starting out, I would
  recommend learning a language first, either on Youtube or some other online
  course. Then, you could possibly follow a tutorial on Youtube in that language
  in whatever you want to build (e.g., a game, a website, etc). They would take
  you through downloading all the right tools, and then building the actual
  project. However, once you follow through a few of these, and know how to set
  up/run a project, building your own thing is a great idea. This would provide
  a better learning opportunity rather than following a tutorial step-by-step.
</p>

<p>
  If you’re interested in web development, I personally followed the Odin
  Project for a while, and it was really cool. They direct you to helpful
  resources that help you learn the language and set up a Linux system, while
  providing projects with structure but letting you build it yourself.
</p>

<p>
  In regards to languages, I recently stumbled across
  <a
    href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/g9zcdu/looking_to_start_a_personal_project_heres_some/"
    target="_blank"
    >this reddit post</a
  >. If you’re not familiar with JavaScript, Java, C/C++ or python, you could
  always start there, since these are pretty basic and broadly used. For my
  summer project, I am planning to make “an application that is backend Java,
  has frontend JavaScript, connects to a database using SQL, with some test
  being in either Maven or Jenkin or Junit”, and “[use] AWS and deploy it to the
  cloud”, as well as an educational game in C++ using Cocos2d-x. I will
  definitely make an update once it's completed.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Call people</h3>
<p>
  Since everyone’s at home bored too, might as well give them a call.
