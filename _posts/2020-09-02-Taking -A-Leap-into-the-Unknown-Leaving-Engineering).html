title: "Taking A Leap into the Unknown: Leaving Engineering"
summary: "It&rsquo;s hard to believe how fast our perspectives change. One year ago
today, I was super excited to start my second year in my dream specialization,
computer engineering. Now, I&rsquo;m leaving the faculty of engineering and
heading into science (with a major computer science), which I believe is more
suitable for me. To the unknowing person, this transition from computer engineering to computer
science may seem natural and uncomplicated. But to me, it was like navigating
a sloped hill in the darkness with a flashlight. I hope to share with you the
whole-decision making process, from the logical aspects, to the &ldquo;leap of
faith&rdquo; as part of the newly understood yet typical college route that
perhaps isn&rsquo;t so straightforward."

  It&rsquo;s hard to believe how fast our perspectives change. One year ago
  today, I was super excited to start my second year in my dream specialization,
  computer engineering. Now, I&rsquo;m leaving the faculty of engineering and
  heading into science (with a major computer science), which I believe is more
  suitable for me.

  To the unknowing person, this transition from computer engineering to computer
  science may seem natural and uncomplicated. But to me, it was like navigating
  a sloped hill in the darkness with a flashlight. I hope to share with you the
  whole-decision making process, from the logical aspects, to the &ldquo;leap of
  faith&rdquo; as part of the newly understood yet typical college route that
  perhaps isn&rsquo;t so straightforward. And even though maybe the switch was
  not as drastic as from engineering to arts per se, it was quite uncomfortable
  for me as someone who is not a great risk-taker.

<h3>Why&rsquo;d I do it?</h3>
<p>
  The logical reason is pretty simple. The biggest one of all being both degrees
  would get me to the same place in the end (a career in software engineering),
  but computer engineering was more arduous with its hardware courses and
  engineering requirements. And to a lesser extent, the faculty of computer
  science has better professors overall.
</p>
<p>
  Even though computer engineering offers a more broad knowledge in computers by
  teaching hardware and electronics, the heavy course load didn&rsquo;t justify
  the rewards it offered to me. I really enjoy having unscheduled time to spend
  either by myself&mdash;writing on this blog, painting&mdash;or with others. I
  also would like to understand more about everything through different courses
  such as psychology, philosophy, astronomy, etc. And a degree in computer
  science would support that flexibility to take elective classes, as well as
  more free time.
</p>
<p>
  And that is totally a personal choice, which will be different for everyone.
  In fact, there is no &ldquo;best&rdquo; college specialization. It really
  comes down to personal preference. Although societally, each major may have a
  certain reputation, employability rating, etc, those are only part of the
  puzzle to consider. Perhaps someone who is interested in hardware may decide
  to switch from computer science to computer engineering. Maybe they find the
  computer science math courses to be arudous, or the arts electives to be
  unnecessary.
</p>
<h3>Why the &ldquo;Leap of Faith&rdquo;?</h3>
<p>
  Having thought out the logic aspects, it became clear that computer science
  was the better option for me. But schools always like to make switching majors
  more complicated than it needs to be; they&rsquo;re always building walls and
  fences around majors when it ideally should be a more fluid process, taking
  into account our ever-changing perspectives as a young person.
</p>
<p>
  So to get to computer science, I&rsquo;d have to switch faculties first, from
  engineering to sciences, and then apply to get into the major of computer
  science. Then the obvious question is: what happens if I don&rsquo;t get into
  computer science?
</p>
<p>
  For a while, I thought I would not be allowed back into computer engineering,
  and be forever stuck in the faculty of sciences, and forced to pick another
  specialization like math, or statistics. But even then, I still wanted to try,
  and decided to drop my computer engineering classes for the remainder of the
  term. Because I knew next year, when I take those 3rd year computer
  engineering courses, I would not be very happy, and would regret not having
  tried to switch out.
</p>
<p>
  And of course, that wasn&rsquo;t an easy conclusion to come to, but the
  decision after talking to friends and family, numerous calls with science
  advising, and an extensive search on Reddit.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, things were better than I thought, and I could still have the
  choice to go back to computer engineering if I were not accepted into computer
  science. And even better, I was indeed accepted into computer science, which
  is where our story ends.
</p>
<h3>How do you feel about the upcoming term in computer science?</h3>
<p>
  The story of how I transferred from computer engineering to computer science
  has ended, but it's not all just flowers and rainbows from here on out. I
  still see foggy shapes in the form of tall mountains looming in the distance.
  I still have my own reservations about computer science, but that will play
  out in time, and in another blog post. Through this experience, I learned that
  if I could have any superpower, it would be to see into the future. Because in
  this journey of life, we have to decide on which mountain trail to take, in
  the darkness with only a flashlight.
