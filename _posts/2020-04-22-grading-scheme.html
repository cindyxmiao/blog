  There has been a lot of speculation about the effects of the 5%/30% new
  grading scheme implemented by the faculty of science. Some people are ecstatic
  that they don’t have to study anymore, while others wonder if they could
  “[keep] original grading scheme as an option” or else the “new grading scheme
  will ruin their chances of getting into their major”.
</p>

<p>
  With the COVID-19 crisis and classes being moved online, the science faculty
  at UBC has decided to make final exams for all courses worth either 30% or 5%,
  whichever maximizes one’s total course grade. The rest of the weightings would
  be scaled accordingly by the professor, but clearly midterms/assignments will
  now occupy a greater chunk of the marks.
</p>

<p>
  It seems to be a pretty sensible decision made on the faculty’s side. First of
  all, it takes the stress off the students (imagine having bad internet
  connection and doing your 60% final exam), and it also mitigates the impact of
  academic dishonesty to some extent (the final won’t be worth enough so that
  cheating will significantly boost your mark).
</p>

<p>
  However, some students are finding this marking scheme very unfavorable, such
  as those who did poorly on their midterms and were hoping to get a good mark
  in final exams. Before you say someone who does bad on midterms will not do
  good in finals either, let’s consider study time: during the term, you might
  not have a lot of time juggling studying for midterms and regularly scheduled
  classes and homework, whereas during finals, you get > 1 week to study. So
  unfortunately for these people (yes myself included), the grading scheme might
  not work very well.
</p>

<p>
  Since the grading scheme is good for some, while bad for others, what does the
  overall picture look like? Should I expect class averages and 2nd year
  specializations averages to be higher or lower?
</p>

<p>
  Mark MacLean, the faculty member of the department of mathematics, conducted
  some analysis<sup>1</sup>. He used past data from year 1 math classes and
  calculated what the curve would look like under the new grading scheme. His
  results are shown as follows:

  So it seems that the class average increased by ~10%. Well that’s the
  prediction, case closed. But not quite.
</p>

<p>
  Although the statistics are great and do show an increase in averages, we see
  some unique circumstances today that will affect this data. One of the
  dominant factors is students' mindset towards a 5%/30% grading scheme. Because
  these statistics were based on past years, where students assumed that their
  final exam marks would be worth the major chunk of their grades, they probably
  studied reasonably well. But if you told these same students that their final
  would only be worth 5%, they would probably won't be inclined to study as
  much, therefore, resulting in lower marks than they would normally receive.
</p>

<p>
  Another factor is the shift from physical lectures to online. Since online
  lectures are recorded anyways, it seems logical to conclude that students will
  be less likely to attend class at regularly scheduled hours, or listen to
  lecture recordings afterwards, if at all. And with the constant bombardment of
  news and changes in the world around us, its even harder to concentrate.
</p>
<p>
  I think that’s one of the biggest reasons that averages for this term will NOT
  increase even though the grading scheme is statistically more favorable.
  Nobody wants to listen to hours and hours of online lectures at home,
  nevermind studying for a 5% final. The data collected on overall averages is
  not an accurate representation of the data for this term; specifically, raw
  marks will be lower. As a result, applying the new grading scheme on these
  lower averages will result in more or less the same averages as before.
</p>

<p>
  As an example consider my Earth Sciences course. Even though the final exam
  was entirely open book, and the questions were mostly straight-forward
  (memorization questions designed for a closed book exam), the average was
  actually 71%. Compare this to our midterm average of 76% which was around the
  same difficulty and a closed book exam. Although this course is the only one
  to have released exam results, I do believe that other courses will follow the
  same pattern. But that’s not a promise, don’t come back and sue me if they
  don’t.
</p>

<p>
  And can I just say that the Dean just ended all the preparatory companies like
  BYC and Prep101 with the new grading scheme?
