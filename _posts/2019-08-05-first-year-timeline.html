<p>First year engineering at UBC had its ups and downs, but in retrospect, I had a pretty great time. Here is my
  experience
  summed up in a narrative timeline.
</p>

<p><span class='bigger'>September: </span> Oh, the joy of moving to a new campus! I moved into Orchard Commons, a UBC
  residence, and my university life officially began. After watching a billion youtube videos about entering college, I
  was so excited to meet new people and make new friends, and would even sit down with random people in the cafeteria
  and start a conversation. Of course, I didn’t become friends with everyone that I met but fortunately I eventually
  found some awesome people in the next couple of days, one that I still call one of my best friends now.

<ul>
  <li>I ran in the election to be part of the engineering first year student council. Lost by 1 vote, nice.</li>
  <li>Also scoured out good secondhand textbooks deals via UBC buy and sell Facebook groups. Typically I buy for 50%
    or less of the original price - don’t be afraid to negotiate!</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><span class='bigger'>October:</span> Physics gets a lot harder, and we take our first midterm. Everything starts to
  fall into a pattern; also started to play intramurals dodgeball, and regularly going to the gym with a buddy.</p>

<p><span class='bigger'>November: </span> We’ve been through a lot of midterms, mostly one after the next for each week.
  I leave my studying mostly to the last weekend before the midterm, but still managed to get a decent mark so I didn’t
  try to improve my studying habits. </p>

<p>Also went to my first hackathon with my rudimentary C++ skills. My friends and I didn’t even know how to get started
  but still a great experience (<a href="https://www.ubyssey.ca/science/ubc-local-hack-day/" target="_blank">article I
    wrote</a>). After this, I promised myself that I
  would learn programming on the side so that next year, I would also be able to present a cool project.
</p>

<p><span class='bigger'>December: </span> Classes come to an end and finals hits. Hard. I left all my studying to one
  week before, and I had to study for 6 finals. Super stressed, tired, and worried, I don’t remember much of this
  time. To make matters worse, my teeth started hurting and it was excruciating pain that just shot up my jaw. After
  getting a root canal done following the end of my exams, my dentist and I came to the conclusion that I had been
  intensely clenching my teeth at night (probably due to stress), damaging the nerve inside. Also, should I mention my
  back/neck also started hurting? Ah I love university.</p>

<p><span class='bigger'>January: </span>After a restful winter break, I go back to school determined: this term was
  going to be different. I didn’t want to get a root canal again. I stop leaving things till later. Once homework is
  assigned, I do it. </p>

<p><span class='bigger'>February: </span> Big snow this year. I remember studying with people and getting excited
  about all the snow potentially leading to a cancelled physics midterm. We were all checking the online discussion
  forum and half-studying when the news hits. I went to bed, study group partied?? Read full post here -> <a
    href="{{site.baseurl}}/snow-day/">Snow Day</a></p>

<p><span class='bigger'>March: </span>Normal school things. Still doing all the assignments waaayyy ahead of deadline,
  and sometimes I would even be waiting for homework to be opened online. Still, I wasn’t doing so hot in linear
  algebra.</p>

<p><span class='bigger'>April: </span> Finals season again. But this time, I was prepared. I spent some time studying
  alone but most of the day I would meet up with a study group. Went to my first BYC course for PHYS 158 (most
  horribly organized and confusing course of the year) and did pretty great in my final exams. At the end of the next
  month, we received our specializations and I successfully made it into computer engineering. Checkpoint passed!</p>

<hr><br>

<p>I still have my battle scars today: my root canal-ed teeth and my neck pains. I think I put way too much time into
  studying because I had forgotten my values and the purpose of higher education. Personally, here are some things
  important to me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical/mental health </li>
  <li>Writing and painting</li>
  <li>Having fun and spending time with friends, family</li>
  <li>Endeavors in coding or other projects</li>
</ul>

<p>But in the busyness of school and getting swamped by the exam-after-exam hailstorm, I really lost sight of these
  values. It was only after school ended that I realized I wasn’t spending time on the things that I really liked.</p>

<p>UBC, especially engineering, is no easy feat. But that’s just university. It sweeps you up and lurches you in its
  deep roaring guts. And the only way to battle against this quashing wave is to stand tall and proud and tell the
  monster... it’s not as important as it thinks.</p>
