<p>As a seasoned university online class taker of 2 months, let me share with you the 2 key strategies of winning at
    online school. It is super simple, like all things in life should be.</p>
<p>Testimonials from satisfied customers:</p>
<p>Chad: &ldquo;I followed the exact advice from <a
        href="https://cindyxmiao.github.io/blog/">https://cindyxmiao.github.io/blog/</a> and ended up with 60% in my
    physics course, with extra time to hang out with my friends! Before that, my mark was 30%!&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Follow (some sort of) schedule</h3>
<p>Since lectures are pre-recorded, it&rsquo;s easy to just throw them to the back of your head, and realize you have a
    heap of 15 lectures * 1 hour each = 15 hours of lectures to go through before that exam in 12 hours. To avoid this,
    I suggest creating a schedule of when you will listen to class.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t even have to be your actual course schedule. If you&rsquo;re not in the Vancouver timezone, maybe
    create a new schedule, and place each course in some time slot that you&rsquo;d like. For example, let&rsquo;s
    listen to three lectures of physics Monday 10-1, and then Math on Tuesday, and so on and so forth. As long as you
    actually follow the schedule, it gives you a lot of flexibility in how you&rsquo;d like to schedule your learning.
    And once in a while, you could even give yourself a few days off in the middle of the week to meet up with friends,
    or just to relax, and do some extra overtime in the other days.</p>
<p>You can really schedule however you like, but the most important part is to stick to it. Which reminds me, I should
    go make mine!</p>
<h3>Be organized</h3>
<p>This is a very obvious one, but hard to do. At least when there were physical classes, you&rsquo;d see friends and
    peers, and you&rsquo;d hear all about that homework assignment due tomorrow, or that midterm coming up. Even if you
    didn&rsquo;t keep track of these dates yourself, it was never really a big deal.</p>
<p>Now, pre-recorded lectures just don&rsquo;t provide the same effect. Not only will we be in a different room than
    everyone else, we probably won&rsquo;t even be listening to lectures at the same time. It&rsquo;s more important now
    than ever to keep track of assignment deadlines, homeworks and exams.</p>

<p>You could possibly do this with an agenda if you&rsquo;re old-school, or use a tool like Google Calendar if you like
    electronic copies. Throughout the term, I like to put important dates on Google Calendar, such as when a project is
    due or all the midterm exam dates. Then, I always know ahead of time if there&rsquo;s something coming up that I
    should prepare for.</p>
<p>Those are the 2 things I think are the most important for online schooling. And to be completely honest, I probably
    didn&rsquo;t do either of those well the first time around when we had online classes back in March. So I will be
    aiming for these 2 important points, and see if it improves my online class experience. Best of luck to everyone!
