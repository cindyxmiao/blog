<p>We used to roll huge balls of snow across the fields,</p>
<p>And throw snowballs at each other,</p>
<p>Like sworn enemies on different sides of the battle field.</p>
<p>There’s something magical about these little pieces of frozen water falling from the sky,</p>
<p>at Christmas time.</p>

<br>

<p>We used to sing Christmas carols,</p>
<p>And make gingerbread houses,</p>
<p>And drive down to Portland for the holidays.</p>
<p>We visited all the waterfalls and museums.</p>
<p>And finished our Christmas shopping.</p>
<p>There’s something magical about getting lost in the bright city lights at night,</p>
<p>at Christmas time.</p>

<br>

<p>We used to decorate the tree,</p>
<p>A tree so mighty that I had to stand on a chair,</p>
<p>And tip toe to put on the ornaments.</p>
<p>It was a great big task,</p>
<p>But all worth it at the end.</p>
<p>There’s something magical about these sparking ornaments,</p>
<p>at Christmas time.</p>

<br>

<p>On the last day of school before the holidays,</p>
<p>We would prepare a tray of brownies for all of our friends,</p>
<p>And wear Santa hats,</p>
<p>And watch performances,</p>
<p>While sucking on candy canes and exchanging presents.</p>
<p>There’s something magical about celebrating with friends,</p>
<p>at Christmas time.</p>

<br>

<p>But I sit here wondering,</p>
<p>Wondering if I can still roll snowballs across the fields,</p>
<p>Or have snow battles,</p>
<p>Or build gingerbread houses,</p>
<p>Or suck on candy canes,</p>
<p>When I’m not so little anymore?</p>
