<h5> Throughout the term: </h5>

<h3> Do: Look at the material BEFORE lectures </h3>

<p> Especially for textbook pre-readings, try to actually understand the material and not just skim the book. This will help a lot in lectures, because the prof assumes that you have already read the textbook material and is building off of the basics. Also, they don’t have enough time to thoroughly explain everything. </p>


<h3> Do: Search online for topics you need more help clarifying </h3>

<p>There are plenty of great online resources like textbooks, videos, etc. Your textbook’s author may not be great at explaining every single concept, so search online to fill in the gaps or for concepts you struggle with. Here are some great resources that have helped me in first year:<p>

<h3>Don’t: Wait until the last moment to do assignments</h3>

<p> Assignments will take the same amount of time, no matter when you choose to do them. Getting it done early will save you a lot of worries. </p>
