<h2 style="font-weight: bold"> Throughout the term </h2>

<br>
<h4> Look at the material BEFORE lectures </h4>

<p> Especially for textbook pre-readings, try to actually understand the material and not just skim the book. This will
    help a lot in lectures, since the prof. builds of the basic in assuming that you have already read the textbook
    material. Be understanding because in some material-heavy courses, they simply don’t have enough time to thoroughly
    explain everything. If there is something in the text you don’t understand, then... </p>

<br>
<h4> Search online for topics you need more help clarifying </h4>

<p>There are plenty of great online resources like textbooks, videos, etc. Your textbook’s author may not be great at
    explaining every single concept, so search online to fill in the gaps or for concepts you struggle with. Here are
    some great resources that have helped me in first year:</p>

<p style="display: inline-block">Physics: </p> <a
    href="https://phys.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/University_Physics/Book%3A_University_Physics_(OpenStax)/Map%3A_University_Physics_II_-_Thermodynamics%2C_Electricity%2C_and_Magnetism_(OpenStax)/1%3A_Temperature_and_Heat"
    style="display: inline-block"> Libretext's Openstax Free Online Textbook </a>

<p>This works great if you missed lectures as well.</p>

<br>
<h4>Don't wait until the last moment to do assignments</h4>

<p> Assignments will take the same amount of time, no matter when you choose to do them. Getting it done early
    will save you a lot of worries. </p>

<br>
<h4> Set out time each day for studying, preferably at the library </h4>

<p>Assignments will take the same amount of time, no matter when you choose to do them. Getting it done early
    will save you a lot of worries. What I find helpful is going to the library for a set amount of time after
    class each day. This ensures that (1) I spend time studying and (2) I am actually productive (working at the
    library is much better than in your bed)</p><br>

<h2><b>For midterms and finals:</b> </h2>

<br>
<h4> Start studying 1 week or more prior to the exam </h4>

<p> If my exam is on Wednesday, I would start studying the Wednesday before. This leaves me with just enough
    time to review all the material, ask questions if needed, and do the practice exams. Sometimes, when I
    haven’t kept up or need a better understanding of the material, I go back and re-read portions of the
    textbooks, or search online. Then, I write out condensed notes of the most important material or concepts.
</p>

<br>
<h4> Go through ~5 practice exams </h4>

<p> Doing practice exams and solving questions are a must for classes like physics or math. For math, the more
    you do, the better and faster you become. For physics, it is a good idea to understand the concepts first
    before proceeding to practice exams.</p>

<br>
<h4>Study alone and with people</h4>

<p> Try to find a study group, as well as a place to meet up for studying. Studying with others gives you
    another reason to not go on your phone, and you can ask others whenever you need. Also, explaining a problem
    to someone else is a great way to reinforce your understanding. </p>

<br>
<h4>Don’t stress about your exams</h4>

<p>Take a nap or get some exercise before your exam. A nap will help you feel well rested and alert, while
    scientific research has shown that exercising before exams can increase your scores! Last minute memorizing
    won’t do you any good now anyways, you’ve been learning and practicing for a few months now, what good is
    another few hours?</p><br>

<h2><b>After you receive your exam back:</b></h2>

<br>
<h4>Understand your mistakes</h4>

<p>If you never reviewed your midterm exams, you’re likely to make the same mistakes again on the
    finals. When you get your test back and after you’ve celebrated/cried/yelled/slept, make look
    through the exam and redo the questions you had trouble with (peaking at the answer key is
    acceptable). Write down where you went wrong somewhere, such as silly mistakes, calculation errors,
    a particularly hard concept, etc, to remind yourself next exam what you need to work on.</p>

<br>
<h4>Be flexible</h4>

<p>If you spent a lot of time studying for the exam, and didn’t get the results you wanted, maybe it’s
    time to change something in the way you study. Instead of reading the textbook, you could make some
    notes, or read things aloud. You could go to another prof’s lecture or follow with online resources
    if your professor is not making any sense. </p>

<p>But if you didn’t put in any effort, don’t go blaming your professor!</p>
