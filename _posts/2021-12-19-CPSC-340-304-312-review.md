*Another year, another course review. In this post, I'll be writing about 340, CPSC 304 & CPSC 312. As usual, I tried to write these as objective as possible by keeping my opinions in the 'My Experience' section, but as a disclaimer, all of these are my experiences only.*

### CPSC 304
#### <ins>Introduction<ins>
All the database things, including ER models (diagrams of databases), database design and normalization, relational query language, SQL, data warehouses and data mining.

The course also includes a project, where you you design a database schema for a real world entity (e.g., school, supermarket), from drafting the database schema diagram, to creating the tables and inserting dummy data, to creating a backend (php or java) to query the database.


#### <ins>Lecture Topics<ins>
- ER diagrams
- database schema normalization, functional dependencies
- relational algebra
- SQL queries
- data warehousing and data mining

#### <ins>Coursework<ins>
- database project with 6 milestones
- 2 midterms

Workload: 2/5  |  Difficulty: 1/5 

I found the course material to be very theoretical for something that I thought was going to be more practical.
Though the project sounds like a practical and good idea, the technology seemed to be pretty outdated (i.e., using SQL*Plus on the command line to access the db to display table contents, I felt like there's definitely better tools out there). 

*Bottom line:* if you already know how to do SQL queries (like I did from my previous co-op), then there's not much additional/useful/interesting takeaways from this course, and don't think that you are obligated to take it because everyone else is or thinks databases are practical/employable. Personally I found that the course clarified a few concepts of SQL queries that I found confusing previously, but for me it wasn't worth a whole term.

But if you don't know anything about SQL, then it is definitely worth learning, either in this course or elsewhere.

### CPSC 340
#### <ins>Introduction<ins>
In this class, you can expect to learn about and implement machine learning models, including classifiers (like decision trees, K-means, and Naive Bayes), linear regression with different loss functions and regularization, minimization algorithms (gradient descent) and neural networks.

Lectures provide the theory as well as pseudo algorithms, while the assignments are using Python to build machine learning algorithms.

This course does have a lot of math, including matrix operations, taking derivatives, statistics (probabilities, distribution), and linear algebra.

#### <ins>Lecture Topics<ins>
- Supervised learning: decision trees, Naive Bayes, KNN
- ML process and principles (training, testing, validation, hyperparameters)
- Unsupervised learning: K-means, Outlier detection
- Linear regression (least squares, regularization) and linear classification
- Latent factor models, principal component analysis (PCA)
- Neural networks and convolutions

#### <ins>Coursework<ins>
- 6 assignments in Latex (mostly code to implement and submit)
- midterm + finals

**My Rating**

Workload: 3.5/5  |  Difficulty: 4/5  |  Engaging-ness: 5/5  

One of the most interesting and fun 3rd year CPSC course at UBC. Lectures were great to attend because the topics are interesting and the prof (Professor Gelbart) delivers them well.

Assignments are done in partners, and mostly consists of code to implement the various ml algorithms. It also includes short answer questions, as well as math derivatives/calculations sometimes. I think I spent a lot more time on the earlier assignments, especially the math parts, but the assignments seemd to get shorter (or maybe I got smarter :) as we progressed into the course. The first assignment I remember spending a week doing, but the last two assignments, after splitting the questions with my partner, required only a few hours.

I think this course is great because 1) interesting topic, 2) amazing slides, 3) great professors, 4) we got to implement parts of the machine learning models ourselves (from scratch, but within the provided skeleton code). More on that latter point, I was actually  skeptical of taking this course because I did some machine learning during my co-op, and it seemed like we were mostly just using pre-built ml libraries, and then choosing some numbers to make it good, which wasn't that fun at all. Now I know that the best part of machine learning is actually coding the model itself, but too bad nobody needs that in the industry.

*Bottom line:* Would recommend 100%, even though you might not be doing ml in the future. It's cool to see what it's about, write some machine learning models, and learn about the applications. However you might not like this course if you don't like theortical-y or calculus stuff, and you should definitely be prepared to take some derivatives!

### CPSC 312
#### <ins>Introduction<ins>
This course provides an overview of 2 languages: Haskell (functional) and Prolog (logical), which are both very different from oo lanaugages like Java or Python. Though the emphasis is mostly focused on how to write code with these languages, it also includes the underlying details of how they work and their potential use cases/strengths.

There is also a group project (2-4 people) where we chose either Haskell or Prolog, and created anything we'd like really, as long as it incorporates something that we explorered by ourselves that wasn't taught in class.

#### <ins>Lecture Topics<ins>
- Haskell (first half of the course)
- Prolog (second half of the course)

#### <ins>Coursework<ins>
- 7 Bi-weekly quizzes
- 1 project
- no final exams/midterms

#### <ins>Experience<ins>

Workload: 1.5/5  |  Difficulty: 3/5 

Most of the course weight was on the bi-weekly quizzes, which contained either M/C questions or very short coding questions with autograder tests. Overall, these were fairly straightforward, and the course itself is not too difficult. However, I did find it hard to adjust to the way of thinking of Haskell and Prolog, and was frustrated at times because "I would be able to do this way easier in Python", again because I wasn't accustomed to the properties of these languages.

I was also very skeptical about the group project, since the project is much more unstructured than I was used to. However, I think it turned out great, and our team was able to build something interesting with Prolog (a grammer checker bot).

*Bottom line:* interesting class, but I didn't find it very useful (at least for now), and there might be other better classes to take.
