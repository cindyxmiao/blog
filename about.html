  <h2>Hi there!</h2>
  <p class="description">
    Iâ€™m Cindy, a 2nd year computer engineering student at UBC. Follow along with
    me in this tempestuous but exciting university journey, from finding an
    internship and studying for exams, to living on my own and questioning my
    life. I'm currently on my first co-op term this summer, and being bored at
    home either writing some blog post, drawing something, chatting with friends
    (online), or playing badminton outside on those once in a blue moon no-wind days.
