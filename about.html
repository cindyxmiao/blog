  <h2>Hi there!</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        I’m a 3rd year computer science student & former computer engineering student @ the University of
        British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>I really enjoyed my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/reflecting-upon-first-year-at-UBC-engineering/">first
          year of engineering at UBC</a>, but here is <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/leaving-engineering/">why I
          left</a>, and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/dear-computer-engineering/">my complaints about CPEN.</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Currently, I'm on my second co-op work term from home, doing full stack development for the first time.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        I started a blog instead in my first year of university to share some of my thoughts and experiences, and as
        I’ve
        always really enjoyed writing and making illustrations. Hope you find something helpful or amusing in my
        writings.
      </p>

  </ul>


  <p> <i>Note: Also because I get asked this, the blog was made through the super simple static site
      generator Jekyll, which generates a nice framework for a site. Only basic git skills is needed, unless one wants
      to alter the template, in which case CSS/Markdown/HTML is required.</i>
