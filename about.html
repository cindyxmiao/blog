  <h2>Hi there!</h2>
  <p class="description">
    I’m Cindy, a 3rd year computer science student & former engineering student @ the University of
    British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    Currently, I’m on my first co-op work term from home, working on remote
    desktop access software.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    I’ve always really enjoyed writing and making illustrations, in fact, I
    would probably would’ve tried to become an artist if I were not going down
    the path of a software engineer.
  </p>

  <p class="description">
    That's why I started a blog instead in my first year of university to share
    some of my thoughts and experiences. Hope you find something helpful or
    amusing in my writings.
  </p>
