        British Columbia (UBC) in Vancouver, Canada.

      <p>I really enjoyed my <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/reflecting-upon-first-year-at-UBC-engineering/">first
          year of engineering at UBC</a>, but here is <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/leaving-engineering/">why I
          left</a>, and <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/dear-computer-engineering/">my complaints about CPEN.</a></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Currently, I'm back in school, and trying to pass my classes and interviews.</p>

        I like writing and creating illustrations, and decided to started this blog in my first year of university
        to share some of my thoughts and experiences.
